<objective>
Create CLI cookbook with recipe-style examples for bmad-automate.

Purpose: Provide quick-start recipes showing "How to do X" patterns that complement CLI_REFERENCE.md (flags) and USER_GUIDE.md (concepts) with practical, copy-and-adapt command patterns.
Output: docs/examples/ folder with cookbook index and recipe files for common workflows.

# Phase context

Vision: Quick-start cookbook with recipe-style examples showing "How to do X" with the CLI.
Essential: Real scenarios, CLI-focused, practical utility.
Out of scope: Library/SDK examples, videos, config deep-dives, exhaustive flag docs.

# Existing docs to complement (not duplicate)

@docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md - Has flag docs and basic examples
@docs/USER_GUIDE.md - Has workflow patterns section

# Prior phase

Phase 17 completed docs folder updates. This phase adds examples/ subfolder.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create cookbook index and basic workflow recipes</name>
  <files>docs/examples/README.md, docs/examples/basic-workflows.md</files>
  <action>
Create docs/examples/ directory and two files:

**README.md** - Cookbook index:

- Title: "CLI Cookbook"
- Brief intro (2-3 sentences): What this is, how to use it
- Navigation table linking to recipe files with short descriptions
- Note pointing to CLI_REFERENCE.md for flag details, USER_GUIDE.md for concepts

**basic-workflows.md** - Single story recipes:

- Title: "Basic Workflow Recipes"
- Recipes for:
  1. "Create a story definition" - create-story with real-looking story key
  2. "Implement a story" - dev-story showing what it does
  3. "Review code changes" - code-review showing auto-fix behavior
  4. "Commit and push" - git-commit with conventional commit note
  5. "Run ad-hoc prompts" - raw command for investigation/exploration
- Each recipe format:
  - Short title (What)
  - 1-2 sentence description (Why/When)
  - Command example with realistic story key
  - Brief expected behavior note

Keep recipes concise - this is a quick reference, not a tutorial.
</action>
<verify>ls docs/examples/ shows README.md and basic-workflows.md</verify>
<done>docs/examples/README.md has cookbook intro and navigation table. docs/examples/basic-workflows.md has 5 recipes for single-story commands.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create lifecycle and batch processing recipes</name>
  <files>docs/examples/lifecycle-automation.md, docs/examples/batch-processing.md</files>
  <action>
Create two advanced recipe files:

**lifecycle-automation.md** - Full lifecycle recipes:

- Title: "Lifecycle Automation Recipes"
- Recipes for:
  1. "Run full lifecycle from any status" - run command showing status->done
  2. "Preview workflow sequence" - --dry-run flag usage
  3. "Resume after failure" - error recovery pattern (.bmad-state.json)
  4. "Force fresh start" - deleting state file to restart
- Each recipe shows the command and brief expected behavior
- Include dry-run output example (from CLI_REFERENCE.md style)

**batch-processing.md** - Multi-story recipes:

- Title: "Batch Processing Recipes"
- Recipes for:
  1. "Process multiple stories" - queue command with 3 story keys
  2. "Preview batch execution" - queue --dry-run
  3. "Process an entire epic" - epic command with epic ID
  4. "Preview epic execution" - epic --dry-run
  5. "Handle mixed-status batches" - shows skip-done behavior
- Include queue summary output example (from CLI_REFERENCE.md style)

Keep consistent format with basic-workflows.md recipes.
</action>
<verify>ls docs/examples/ shows lifecycle-automation.md and batch-processing.md</verify>
<done>docs/examples/lifecycle-automation.md has 4 lifecycle recipes. docs/examples/batch-processing.md has 5 batch recipes. All files consistent format.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update docs README.md with examples link</name>
  <files>docs/README.md</files>
  <action>
Add examples/ folder reference to docs/README.md navigation.

Find the documentation navigation section and add a link to examples/:

- Add "Examples" or "CLI Cookbook" entry pointing to examples/README.md
- Brief description: "Recipe-style CLI examples"

This connects the new cookbook to the existing docs structure.
</action>
<verify>grep -q "examples" docs/README.md</verify>
<done>docs/README.md has link to examples/ cookbook in navigation.</done>
</task>
